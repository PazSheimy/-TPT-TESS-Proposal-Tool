This module sets up and runs the Flask application.

It imports the register_routes function, initializes a Flask app object, and registers the routes.
The module also includes additional routes for TIC data lookup and TIC ID processing.

Dependencies:
- flask
- routes
- requests
- jsonify
- utils.sector_processingA custom module containing functions to process data related to celestial targets, 
such as converting TIC IDs to RA and DEC coordinates, and processing CSV files containing target information.
